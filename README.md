# DARC pyTorch code

This code is under development, please go to https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/darc for latest code, and to reproduce experiements on the paper) 
Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning(ODRL): Training for Transfer with Domain Classifiers
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13916

DARC - ODRL experiements are done under branches: ODRL(pointenv), ODRL_mujoco( pybullet and mujoco experiements), ODRL_lunar_lander( Lunar Lander env). The branches are yet to be merged and needed to be tested on some of the experiments in the paper. 

This work is on the top of SAC algorithm from rlkit framework by Vitchyr https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit.
