# DARC pyTorch code
Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning(ODRL): Training for Transfer with Domain Classifiers

This code is under development, please go to https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/darc for latest code, and to reproduce experiments on the paper) 

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13916

DARC - ODRL experiments are performed under branches: ODRL(pointmass env), ODRL_mujoco(pybullet and mujoco experiments), ODRL_lunar_lander( Lunar Lander env). The branches are yet to be merged and need to be tested on some of the experiments in the paper. 

This work is on the top of SAC algorithm from rlkit framework by Vitchyr https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit.
