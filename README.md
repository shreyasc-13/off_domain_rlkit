# DARC pyTorch code
Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning(ODRL): Training for Transfer with Domain Classifiers

This code is in development, please go to https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/darc for latest code, and to reproduce experiments on the paper) 

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13916

DARC - ODRL experiments are performed under branches: ODRL(pointMass env), ODRL_mujoco(HalfCheetah, Reacher, Ant bullet and in development mujoco experiments), ODRL_lunar_lander( Lunar Lander gym env). The branches are yet to be merged and need to be tested on some of the experiments in the paper. 

This work is done on the top of SAC algorithm from rlkit framework by Vitchyr https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit.
